# Rack Responses Lab

Let's create a quick time-appropriate greeter application

## Instructions

Edit your code in `app/application.rb`.

Create your application with the following conditions:

  1. If it's before noon, greet the user with "Good Morning!"
  2. If it's after noon, greet the user with "Good Afternoon!". Remember that
     getting the time may return results in 24 hour time! Anytime on or after 12
     is the afternoon.
